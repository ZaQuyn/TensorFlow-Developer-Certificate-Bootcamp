## Table of materials üìñ
This table is the ground truth for course materials. All the links you need for everything will be here.

Key:
* **Number:** The number of the target notebook (this may not match the video section of the course but it ties together all of the materials in the table)
* **Notebook:** The notebook for a particular module with lots of code and text annotations (notebooks from the videos are based on these)
* **Data/model:** Links to datasets/pre-trained models for the associated notebook
